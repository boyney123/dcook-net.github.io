Following on from @Ardalis, I've created a list of resources I find useful in my day-to-day role and would recommend to other web developers, new and old.


# Tools that I'm using:
Hereâ€™s a quick list of the tools I use and generally recommend for web development.

- .Net Core 2.1 & 2.2 (In the process of upgrading now)
- Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 (currently on version 15.9.3)
- Resharper and the IntelliJ shortcuts - I use these constantly to improve productivity
- Visual Studio Live Share - a really useful tool for pairing with people, both remotely and co-located 
- Live Unit Testing - automatically reruns your test suite and provides red/green line indicators
- Docker 
- MongoDB - Data storage in JSON format
- Postman - Rest Client
- Beyond Compare 4 - because comparing json files by eye is crazy! Or any files for that matter.


# Useful Nuget Packages:

- AutoFixture - really useful package for automatically creating test data for you - saves having to write code for many unit test scenarios 
- Scrutor - A great package for implementing the Decorator pattern with .Net Core's built in DI
- NUnit - Unit Testing Framework for .Net Framework and .Net Core
- NuKeeper - Command line tool for automating Nuget package dependencies - integrates with github


# Web sites / services
- Azure Devops / Azure Pipelines - I use this to build and deploy my open-source projects 
- https://dependabot.com/ - On line service for automating package dependencies - integrates with github
- Github - source control...on the command line...just because!


# Useful Browser Extensions

- OctoTree 
- JsonViewer - nicely formats json files in the browser, and makes nodes collapsible/expandable 
- Restlet - browser based rest client
